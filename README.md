**CircularCloset ‚ôªÔ∏è** is an innovative social media platform designed to revolutionize the way you organize your closet! With CircularCloset, you can effortlessly create virtual compartments that mirror the structure of your physical closet. Seamlessly upload and categorize your clothing items, allowing you to easily browse and locate your favorite pieces.

But that's not all! CircularCloset goes beyond traditional closet organization by fostering a vibrant community of like-minded individuals who share your passion for organizing and sustainability. Connect with others who are also building their virtual closets.

One of the key features of CircularCloset is the ability to share and swap clothing items within the community.

## Backlog
I have an exciting roadmap ahead for **CircularCloset**, with several features planned to enhance your closet organization experience. Here are some key items in my backlog:

* **Customizable Closet View** In the upcoming updates, I plan to introduce a visually immersive main page that simulates an actual closet. Users will have the ability to build and customize a front view of their closet, complete with compartments that mirror the real-life structure. This feature will provide a unique and aesthetically pleasing interface for organizing your virtual wardrobe.

* **Advanced Search Functionality** To enhance item discovery and retrieval, I aim to incorporate advanced search capabilities. Users will be able to search for specific items in their closet by their color and/or type, allowing for efficient filtering based on their preferences. **CircularCloset** will display the compartments where the matching items are located, simplifying the process of finding and retrieving the desired pieces.

* **Color Combination Suggestions** I understand the challenges of coordinating outfits based on color combinations. Hence, I plan to introduce a unique feature that leverages the **Circle of Color Theory.** CircularCloset will provide users with randomly generated outfit suggestions by combining colors that harmonize well together. This feature will be a great source of inspiration and assistance for users in creating stylish and coordinated looks.

These upcoming features, along with other exciting updates, will further streamline and enhance your closet organization journey. Stay tuned for more updates as I work to make CircularCloset your go-to platform for sustainability and style! ‚ôªÔ∏èüëöüëó‚ú®
